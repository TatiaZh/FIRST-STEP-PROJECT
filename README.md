# TECHUB FIRST STEP PROJECT 
## Student Management Systemt 

As a first step project you are going to develop **Student management system** using only HTML/CSS/Javascript 
The application will have a main table, where the student’s names are listed with the grade points assigned to them for every lecture and the average of points. 

Application has information about **Statistics of Student’s Results** which is divided into 

    1. Total number of days 
    2. Missed Lessons 
        a. It is the total number of missed lessons by all students
    3. Average grade 
    4. Total number of students 
    
**Table Section:** 

    1. The ability to add a new day 
        a. This days are counted and are matched our current timetable how techhub's course has, 
           starting from 30 April 
    2. The ability to remove the last added day 
    3. Update table which also updates statistic information 
        a. it would be better if the statistics are updated all the time and not only after clicking the button
    4. Grade Min: the minimum value is 0, 
       any input lower than 0 is taken as zero and zero also represents missed lesson. 
       Each square including 0 should be color red. 
    5. Grade Max: maximum value is 5, any input higher than 5 is considered as 5.  
    6. The point squares are editable any time. 
       The Edit operation starts the users clicks in the cell  and appears javascript Prompt window. 
    7. each column except average column must have date title.  
    
**Note** - Application should have responsive web design, Also separate the logic (Javascript code) from the design and the HTML pages.
